# Background

Three UK is owned by a Hong Kong-based conglomerate named CK Hutchison, which also owns Three in various other countries, including Ireland,
Austria, Denmark, Italy (WindTre), and more. Hutchison are deeply ingrained within the history of UK mobile networks, with Three UK being their
third UK mobile network since they entered the market.

Vodafone UK is the third largest mobile network in the UK, as of 2022, and is owned by Vodafone Group, a British multinational telecommunications
company headquartered in Newbury, England. Vodafone Group is the second largest mobile network operator in the world, operating networks in 21
countries and partners in a further 47.

## History of Three

### Rabbit

CK Hutchison launched their first UK mobile network in May 1992 named Rabbit. Rabbit offered CT2 (often seen as the precursor to modern DECT)
coverage within 100m of their transmitters, and, at their peak, operated 12,000 base stations and provided services to 10,000 subscribers.

Rabbit ceased operations only 20 months after launch. This was primarily due to the imminent launch of newer analogue GSM on competitor networks,
such as Vodafone and BT Cellnet, who also offered an incoming calls service. Hutchison lost close to $183 million from the failure of Rabbit, but
this wouldn't make them think twice about another entry into the UK market.

### Orange

While Rabbit was being launched, in July 1991, Hutchison acquired a controlling stake in a business named Microtel, who obtained a license to run
a GSM-based mobile network in the UK. Hutchison renamed this business to Orange Personal Communication Services (PCS) in March 1994.

Services on Orange launched exactly a month later in April 1994 on 1800 MHz, contracting an advertising agency to create a now iconic slogan for
those living through the era, "The future's bright, the future's Orange." Orange made their intial public offering and floated on the London
stock exchange in April 1996, and became the youngest company to enter the FTSE100 in June 1996, with a valuation of £2.4 billion.

Orange PCS was eventually purchased in October 1999 by German conglomerate Mannesmann for $33 billion, which caused Vodafone to make a hostile
takeover bid for the German company. 4 months later, in February 2000, Vodafone Group announced it had completed an acquisition of Mannesmann for
$128 billion, but was forced to divest Orange due to EU competition regulations with regards to mobile licenses. In May 2000, it was announced
that France Télécom (France's now-privatised telecommunications provider) would purchase Orange PCS for $37 billion, completing the sale in
August of that year.

Orange UK later merged with T-Mobile UK in 2010 to form a new company named Everything Everywhere, which is still in operation today as simply
"EE". The Orange brand was phased out completely by mid-2015, and EE was purchased by BT Group in 2016 following unconditional approval by the
UK's Competition and Markets Authority.

### Three

Three UK is Hutchison's third play at a UK mobile network, so far. It launched on 3 March 2003 (3/3/03), offering a fully 3G-based network
without any GSM functionality unlike the other networks at the time. Three was the first UK network to meet the coverage obligation within its
network license of 80% of the population, doing so by 9 December 2004, with some networks following behind, and
[Vodafone failing to meet their 90% coverage obligation entirely](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/07/vodafone-fails-minimum-3g-mobile-internet-coverage).

At the start of its operations, Three partnered with O2 to provide national roaming on O2's GSM service in order to offer coverage parity outside
of their own 3G areas. Three replaced O2's services with Orange in May 2006, who provided GSM fallback into 2015 when Three opted to switch off
national roaming entirely.

In 2007, Three UK and T-Mobile UK announced a joint venture named MBNL to consolidate their network infrastructure build and upgrades programme,
with the goal of reducing costs and improving coverage. Later, this expanded to include Orange UK after it merged with T-Mobile to form EE. MBNL
started to wind down from April 2023, with Three and EE handling upgrades and maintenance unilaterally into the future.

Three pioneered the concept of the EU's "roam like at home" policies, with customers, until 2009, able to roam on Three's other networks in
Europe at no additional cost compared to their domestic pricing. This restarted in 2013, with further countries without Three networks being
added in coming years, before the re-introduction of roaming fees from 2021 due to the UK's exit from the EU.

Three's merger talks with Vodafone are not Hutchison's first attempt at a merger with another network, first announcing in March 2015 that a deal
had been struck with O2 to acquire its UK-based operations for a total of £10.25 billion. This purchase was blocked by the EU Commission on the
grounds it would significantly affect competition within the UK market.

## Merger with Vodafone

Three's latest merger talks are with Vodafone, for which rumours first began circulating around May 2022. These talks were potentially sparked by
Liberty Global and Telefónica UK's merger of their respective businesses (Virgin Media and O2) in 2021, but had likely been considered prior to
this.

The pairing of Vodafone and Three may seem odd at first, considering the two businesses' differences in operations. Vodafone UK is a
long-standing, traditional brand which many young people may interpret as "old", meanwhile Three is the youth-centric brand that offers fantastic
value for money data across its own brand and its in-house MVNO, SMARTY, exacerbated by Three removing fair usage caps from their unlimited plans
entirely in 2022.

In actual fact, this combination works very well. Vodafone has both a strong brand awareness, as well as a huge infrastructure network of both
mobile base stations, and its own dark fibre network across the UK. Vodafone also has a strong presence in the enterprise market, with Three UK
having a strong presence in the consumer market. With the two networks being the two smallest in the UK, it's unsurprising why they would like to
join forces to compete against the larger BT/EE and Virgin Media O2.

## Infrastructure

### Cornerstone and Beacon

<figure>

<figcaption>

</figure>

Vodafone has a large infrastructure network of mobile base stations across the UK, operated in partnership with O2 under the joint venture
Cornerstone. Cornerstone was formed in 2009, and is responsible for the maintenance and upgrades of both Vodafone and O2's mobile networks, with
the two networks sharing the same infrastructure. The two networks share repsonsibility of the infrastructure by splitting the country into zones
under projects named Beacon 1 and Beacon 2.

Cornerstone and Beacon means that Vodafone has reliable coverage arrangements across the entire UK, which could extend to Three in the case of a
merger. Some speculation suggests the Cornerstone agreement could be terminated in the case of a merger, but this would also place O2 at such a
disadvantage across huge swaths of the UK so it appears very unlikely.

That being said, many major UK cities (including London, Birmingham, Brighton, Cardiff, Manchester, and Liverpool) are already being "unwound" in
another project named Beacon 3. In these areas, shared infrastructure is being separated into two networks, with Vodafone and O2 each taking
responsibility for their own infrastructure and, hence, network coverage.

### Three's rapid 5G expansion

In the past few years, Three have invested heavily in expanding their 5G coverage through new streetworks sites. The unilateral streetworks
programme consists of slimline monopoles across towns, cities and the countryside that are capable of hosting Three's full range of technologies.

Three's rapid deployment programme is a huge success, with the networking having over 4,250 live 5G sites as of May 2023, up from 2,200 in 2022.
This rollout is shown by Three taking the crown for fastest median and peak 5G speeds in the UK
[according to Ookla](https://www.ookla.com/articles/three-5g-performance-uk-ireland-austria-q2-2023). Three have also been working on upgrading
backhaul to all their sites to 10 Gbps to maximise 5G performance. We have seen single user
[peaks of up to 2.1 Gbps on Three 5G](https://twitter.com/davwheat_/status/1649699563530334208) which is near impossible to achieve on other UK
networks.

<div className="narrow">

| Network     | Median 5G speed |
| ----------- | :-------------: |
| Three UK    |   275.83 Mbps   |
| Vodafone UK |   138.90 Mbps   |
| EE          |   111.14 Mbps   |
| O2 UK       |   70.63 Mbps    |

</div>

### Post-merger infrastructure

A merger between Vodafone and Three would result in significant overlap of infrastructure from the two networks' current coverage portfolio. A
big question is what steps would be taken to consolidate the two networks into one, and what would happen to the infrastructure that is no longer
needed.

Although the mobile tower market in 2023 is very different to that of 2010, we are likely to see a similar process take place as that which
happened at EE when T-Mobile and Orange merged. The network will attempt to identify sites with coverage not provided by any other sites and
those that provide capacity that is hard to supplement with other masts, keep those and then decommission the others slowly. In EE's case the
decision-making process was complicated by the need to offer Three 'free' access to some sites as part of the competition mitigation allowing the
deal to proceed and by Three choosing to 'buy in' to some sites. Sticking with the tried and tested EE playbook, it is likely that the sites will
be grouped into clusters and prioritised for rebuild to a single design standard.

Media reports have suggested that the details of this outline plan have been a sticking point in the merger negotiations, however the merger
comes at a time when all networks are attempting to monetise their existing grids and increase the tenancy ratio (the number of networks using
each mast). Grid monetisation would mean that a nimbler approach, choosing the best of both major UK grids, may be the ideal way forward. The
contracts underpinning tower monetisation, typically 15&ndash;20-year deals, may be a stumbling block in a quick decommission programme to
realise the merger benefits, however the precise details are naturally commercially sensitive.

## Spectrum

For a mobile network, spectrum is critical. It is the radio waves that carry the data and voice traffic between the mobile phone and the network.
Essentially, the more spectrum a network has, the higher peak speeds it can offer to customers, and the greater the capacity of the network.

When the merger between T-Mobile and Orange began, it became clear that the combined network would have too much spectrum. This was reported by
[The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2009/09/10/t_orange_spectrum/) before it became clear the merge-co didn't want to give up any of its
valuable spectrum
([ISPReview](https://www.ispreview.co.uk/story/2009/11/24/t-mobile-and-orange-uk-refuse-to-share-mobile-broadband-spectrum.html)).

An [investigation](https://ec.europa.eu/competition/publications/cpn/2010_2_6.pdf) by the EU into the merger found that the merged company would
hold almost 48% of the UK's mobile spectrum and "[the] merger could thus possibly have led the parties to have the only full-speed national LTE
network in the short to medium term".

At the end, the merged company opted to divest a quarter (15&nbsp;MHz paired) of their 1800&nbsp;MHz spectrum, as well as other concessions, to
allow the merger to pass through competition regulators.

### Current spectrum outlook

We have a [full page on UK spectrum allocations](/gb/spectrum), but we can summarise total allocations per-network at the time of publishing.

</figure>

#### Sub-6 5G

Three is best-placed for 5G with 140&nbsp;MHz n78 currently deployed with 84&nbsp;MHz in the n77 band, although this is not currently suitable
for 5G use due to license restrictions. Vodafone have the second-highest n78 allocation at 90&nbsp;MHz, split into two blocks of 40 and
50&nbsp;MHz.

A merger between the two with no intervention would result in significant Sub-6 5G spectrum holdings, maxing out a 2CA n78 configuration with
30&nbsp;MHz left over spare.

#### Low band

Low band is critical to rural and indoor coverage. Currently, O2 has the greatest amount of low band spectrum, with holdings in 700, 800 and 900
MHz totalling 37.4&nbsp;MHz, and EE trails just behind with 35&nbsp;MHz in 700 and 800 MHz.

Three has the least low band spectrum out of all UK networks, which becomes clear when looking at their rural performance across the country.
Since 700 MHz was only auctioned in 2021, Three's primary low band deployment for almost a decade has been a painful 5&nbsp;MHz of B20 LTE, with
many locations being served by only B20 LTE coming from shared sites with EE.

</figcaption>
</figure>

### Post-merger spectrum outlook

A merger of Vodafone and Three would provide a total of 42.4&nbsp;MHz of low band spectrum which, combined with the larger pool of infrastructure
provided through Cornerstone, MBNL and Three's own portfolio, would offer a significant rural density upgrade on the current networks.
